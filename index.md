370 four-part chorales by Johann Sebastian Bach
===============================================

Four-part chorales collected after J.S. Bach's death by his son C.P.E. Bach (and finished by Kirnberger, J.S. Bach's student, after C.P.E. Bach's death). Ordered by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel numbers.

The first complete edition of these chorales was published by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel between 1784&ndash;1787 in four volumes. The first incomplete edition consisting of 200 chorales in two volumes was published by Friedrich Wilhelm Birnstiel in 1765 & 1769, reprinted in 1975 by Georg Olms.

This digital edition is referenced against the fourth edition of the chorales by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel, c. 1875: 371 vierstimmige Choralges&auml;nge von Johann Sebastian Bach. 4th ed. by Alfred D&ouml;rffel. Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel, Leipzig [c. 1875]. 178 pp. Plate Number: V.A.10. Retypeset c. 1915 as Edition Breitkopf 10. Reprinted by Associated Music Publishers, Inc., New York [c. 1940].

The source edition has 371 chorales, but chorale 150 is not a four-part chorale, so it has been 
omitted from this analytic edition of the chorales.  However the numbering of the chorales is maintained
as in the source edition, with file `chor150.krn` not existing in this digital edition.

These digital scores can also be found as a submodule in the 
[humdrum-data](https://github.com/humdrum-tools/humdrum-data) repository.


Data processing tools and other resources
=========================================

This digital edition is in the Humdrum file format.  Tools for processing files in this format can be found online at:
   https://github.com/humdrum-tools

These digital scores may also be found on the kernScores website:
     http://kernscores.stanford.edu/browse?l=370chorales
with mirrors at:
     http://kern.humdrum.org/browse?l=370chorales
     http://kern.ccarh.org/browse?l=370chorales
which includes dynamic conversions to other data formats.  

The Humdrum Extras command-line programs can download the files from kernScores.  A quick method of downloading:
    mkdir chorales
    cd chorales
    humsplit h://370chorales
To get online access to a single chorale, for example to transpose the first chorale to C major:
   transpose -k c h://370chorales/chor001.krn
To interface to the Humdrum Toolkit commands, use the humcat command to download to standard input (the -s option is needed when downloading multiple files):
   humcat -s h://370chorales | census -k

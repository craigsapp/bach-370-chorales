Four-part chorales collected after J.S. Bach's death by his son C.P.E. Bach (and finished by Kirnberger, J.S. Bach's student, after C.P.E. Bach's death). Ordered by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel numbers.

The first complete edition of these chorales was published by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel between 1784&ndash;1787 in four volumes. The first incomplete edition consisting of 200 chorales in two volumes was published by Friedrich Wilhelm Birnstiel in 1765 & 1769 (reprinted by Georg Olms, 1975).

This digital edition is referenced against the fourth edition of the chorales by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel, c. 1875: 371 vierstimmige Choralges&auml;nge von Johann Sebastian Bach. 4th ed. by Alfred D&ouml;rffel. Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel, Leipzig [c. 1875]. 178 pp. Plate Number: V.A.10. Retypeset c. 1915 as Edition Breitkopf 10. Reprinted by Associated Music Publishers, Inc., New York [c. 1940].

The source edition has 371 chorales, but chorale 150 is not a four-part chorale, so it has been 
omitted from this analytic edition of the chorales.  However the numbering of the chorales is maintained
as in the source edition, with file `chor150.krn` not existing in this digital edition.

These digital scores can also be found as a submodule in the 
[humdrum-data](https://github.com/humdrum-tools/humdrum-data) repository.

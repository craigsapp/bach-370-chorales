collected after his death by son <a target="blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach">C.P.E.
Bach</a>, but finished by <a target="blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Kirnberger">Kirnberger</a>,
J.S. Bach's student, after C.P.E. Bach's death. 

The first complete edition of these chorales was published by Breitkopf

This <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/craigsapp/bach-370-chorales/tree/master/kern">digital
edition</a> is referenced against the fourth edition of the chorales by
Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel, c.&nbsp;1875: <i>371 vierstimmige Choralges&auml;nge
von Johann Sebastian Bach</i>, 4th ed. by Alfred D&ouml;rffel, 178
pp, plate number V.A.10. Re-typeset c.&nbsp;1915 as Edition Breitkopf 10.
Reprinted by Associated Music Publishers, Inc., New York [c.&nbsp;1940].

The source edition has 371 chorales, but chorale 150 is not a four-part
chorale, so it has been removed from this analytic edition.  However,
chorale numbering is maintained as in the source edition, with file
<i>chor150.krn</i> omitted.

All notation on this website is typeset dynamically by the <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.verovio.org">Verovio</a>
music engraver, interfaced through the <a target="_blank"
href="http://plugin.humdrum.org">Humdrum notation plugin</a>.  If you
click on the <span style="opacity:0.5" class="button demo">Edit in
VHV</span> button above the music for a chorale, it will be loaded into
<a target="_blank" href="http://verovio.humdrum.org">Verovio Humdrum
Viewer</a>, where you can listen to and edit the music. Also, check out
the <a target="_blank" href="/typesetter">chorale typesetter</a> on this
website, where you can adjust the layout of a chorale, transpose it,
extract parts and then save an SVG image of the notation for use
on your own webpage or as a word-processor figure (saving currently not
available in Firefox).

These
digital scores can also be found as a submodule in the <a target="_blank"

repository.
